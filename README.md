# Introduction
Human emotion detection is implemented in many areas requiring additional security or information about the person. Another important domain where we see the importance of emotion detection is for business promotions. Most of the businesses thrive on customer responses to all their products and offers. Also,the use of machines in society has increased widely in the last decades such as robots and in this context, deep learning has the potential to become a key factor to build better interaction between humans and machines, while providing machines with some kind of self-awareness about its human peers, and how to improve its communication with natural intelligence. 
- Motivation and goals
This project is a part of Data Science Academy by Brainster with the primary goal, students to practically demonstrate the acquired knowledge. Technically, the project’s goal consists on training a deep neural network with labeled images of facial emotions. Finally, this is a multidisciplinary project involving affective computing, machine learning and computer vision. Learning how these different fields are related, and to understand how they can provide solutions to complex problems is another project’s goal.
