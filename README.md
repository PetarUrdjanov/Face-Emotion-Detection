# Face Detection and Emotion Recognition [![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
- Tech/Fameworks used: OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, OpenCV and Deep Learning (look at the requirements.txt file)

## Introduction
Human emotion detection is implemented in many areas requiring additional security or information about the person. Another important domain where we see the importance of emotion detection is for business promotions. Most of the businesses thrive on customer responses to all their products and offers. Also,the use of machines in society has increased widely in the last decades such as robots and in this context, deep learning has the potential to become a key factor to build better interaction between humans and machines, while providing machines with some kind of self-awareness about its human peers, and how to improve its communication with natural intelligence. 

> **Motivation and goals**

This project is a part of Data Science Academy by Brainster with the primary goal, students to practically demonstrate the acquired knowledge. Technically, the project’s goal consists on training a deep neural network with labeled images of facial emotions. Finally, this is a multidisciplinary project involving affective computing, machine learning and computer vision. Learning how these different fields are related, and to understand how they can provide solutions to complex problems is another project’s goal. 

## :bulb: Materials and Methods
The task in this project is to create a robust Image classifier, that given an image will find all of the faces within the image and then recognize the emotion of the person. The **7 emotions** besides neutral class that classifier will need to choose from are:

We can generalize the emotion detection steps as follows:
- *Dataset preprocessing*
- *Face detection*
- *Feature extraction*
- *Classification based on the features*

This project has been divided into two phases: 

> The first phase consisted on the use of a facial emotion labeled data set to train a deep learning network.More details about can be found in Chapter **Data**.

> The second phase focused on testing the model, a detailed explanation is presented in Chapter **Models**
